Abstract:
*Wolbachia* is a maternally inherited obligate endosymbiont that can induce a wide spectrum of effects in its host, ranging from mutualism to reproductive parasitism. At the genomic level, recombination within and between strains, transposable elements, and horizontal transfer of strains between host species make Wolbachia an evolutionarily dynamic bacterial system. The invasive cherry fruit fly *Rhagoletis cingulata* arrived in Europe from North America ~40 years ago, where it now co‐occurs with the native cherry pest *R. cerasi*. This shared distribution has been proposed to have led to the horizontal transfer of different *Wolbachia* strains between the two species. To better understand transmission dynamics, we performed a comparative genome study of the strain wCin2 in its native United States and invasive European populations of *R. cingulata* with wCer2 in European R. cerasi. Previous multilocus sequence genotyping (MLST) of six genes implied that the source of wCer2 in *R. cerasi* was wCin2 from *R. cingulata*. However, we report genomic evidence discounting the recent horizontal transfer hypothesis for the origin of wCer2. Despite near identical sequences for the MLST markers, substantial sequence differences for other loci were found between wCer2 and wCin2, as well as structural rearrangements, and differences in prophage, repetitive element, gene content, and cytoplasmic incompatibility inducing genes. Our study highlights the need for whole‐genome sequencing rather than relying on MLST markers for resolving *Wolbachia* strains and assessing their evolutionary dynamics.
