Experimental evolution is extensively used to address questions of evolutionary biology by exposing evolving populations to different environmental conditions. It offers the opportunity to replicate experiments and test for convergent outcomes. With the recent drop in DNA sequencing cost and the advance of sequencing technologies, the combination of experimental evolution with next generation sequencing of pools of individuals (Evolve & Resequence) has become a state-of-the-art method to link phenotypic responses to genetic changes. Although the availability of replicated time series data is one key advantage of E&R, the analysis of such data sets is still in its infancy. This course will introduce the participants to several new approaches for the analysis of genomic time series data covering the latest software tools as well as required statistical and computational skills.

The course was targeted towards researchers interested in experimental evolution combined with NGS and will cover the design of experimental evolution studies as well as the analysis of Pool-Seq time series data.
