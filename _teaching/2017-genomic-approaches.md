Genomics and genome evolution from next-generation sequencing data, such as whole-genome sequencing, RAD sequencing and transcriptomics. We want to exemplify genomic investigation procedures to trace natural selection, genetic ancestry, function, structure and gene-environment interactions, starting with introducing basic omic approaches, such as de novo assembly and mapping.
