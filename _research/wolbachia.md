Endosymbiotic bacteria are ubiquitous in animals, being especially
abundant in arthropods. They are usually studied in terms of the costs and benefits that they convey to
their hosts. However,
endosymbionts and their hosts also provide excellent opportunities to examine the processes of
colonization and range expansion. Here, we propose to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of the
early stages of possible bi-directional horizontal transfer of the endosymbiont Wolbachia
between native and invasive species of cherry-infesting Rhagoletis fruit flies in Europe. The
system provides a unique chance to study in real time how intra- and inter-trophic level interactions
between different strains of Wolbachia and their fly hosts may affect the dynamics of their respective
distributions and spread through Europe.
The genus Rhagoletis contains over 90 taxa and is comprised of a number of different species groups.
One well-known group is the R. pomonella sibling species complex in North America. These flies,
which include the apple and hawthorn host races of the species R. pomonella, are models for
ecological speciation in the absence of geographic isolation via host plant shifts. The
focus of the current study is on a related species complex called the R. cingulata group that contains
four described sibling species that infest different native cherry and olive hosts across N. America
(Bush 1966; St. Jean et al. in rev.). In particular, we are interested in the species R. cingulata that
infests native black cherries (Prunus serotina) and is also a pest of domesticated cherries in the eastern
and southwestern US, and Mexico. Evidence suggests that R. cingulata was introduced into Europe
~30 years ago, where it now infests cherries with the native European species R. cerasi, that belongs to
a third species group. The shared habitat of the two flies in cherries appears to have resulted in the
horizontal transmission of Wolbachia strain wCer1 from R. cerasi to R. cingulata, where it is
designated wCin1 (Schuler et al. 2013). In addition, a second strain of Wolbachia, wCin2, that is
present in all R. cingulata populations in N. America, has also been found in certain R. cerasi
populations in Europe (where it is designated wCer2). Thus, a dynamic interplay is occurring in an
ecological timeframe between two strains of Wolbachia in two different Rhagoletis hosts in Europe,
with one bacteria strain and one fly species being native, and the other bacteria strain and fly species
being introduced and invasive. The goal of this grant is to resolve the evolutionary interplay
between Wolbachia and Rhagoletis in Europe, and, thus, gain insight into the nature and roles

that intra- and inter-trophic interactions play in the process of endosymbiont invasion
