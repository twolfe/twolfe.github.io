Hello,
I am happy to inform you that I'm starting a new research project with [Hannes Shuler](https://sites.google.com/view/hschuler/home). The main goal of our project aims to resolve the evolutionary interplay between Wolbachia and Rhagoletis cingulata in Europe and gain insights into the nature and roles
of horizontal Wolbachia transfers for invasive potential.
Exited to start a keep you updated.
