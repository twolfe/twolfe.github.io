Phenotypic variation, upon which natural selection acts, is central to the adaptive potential of species to diverse environments. Classically, variation was considered to accumulate slowly through sources such as mutations and reshuffling of standing variation by recombination and migration. This "unreserved" view of evolution was already put into question by Thomas H. Huxley in a famous 1859 letter to Charles Darwin while reading the manuscript of *On the Origin of Species* for the first time.

> The only objections that have occurred to me are 1st, That you have loaded yourself with an unnecessary difficulty in adopting Natura non facit saltum so unreservedly; and 2nd, It is not clear to me why, if continual physical conditions are of so little moment as you suppose, variation should occur at all. However, I must read the book two or three times more before I presume to begin picking holes.

Thomas. H. Huxley 23 November 1859

In this context, sudden, saltational and substantial scale changes in phenotypes due to alterations in homeotic genes or modifications in genome organization, such as hybridization or polyploidy (whole-genome doubling) were deemed maladaptive and detrimental.

My work focuses on evolutionary processes which generate or maintain genetic variation and their impact on biodiversity.

Insecticide resistance is a classic example for rapid evolution. Because in the absence of insecticides resistance alleles confer a significant cost, their frequencies in natural populations are considered to reflect the intensity of insecticide treatment. The neurotransmitter Acetylcholine is metabolized by *Ace*, which is a common target of insecticides. Resistance alleles show seasonal and clinal variation consistent with more intense insecticide treatment in the warm when insects are more abundant. Here, we use laboratory natural selection of a natural *Drosophila simulans* population to study the cost of resistance in insecticide free environment. Interestingly, the cost of resistance differs dramatically in hot and cold conditions. While resistance alleles are only weakly selected in hot (s=-0.012), in the cold they bare a high cost (s=-0.058). We propose that selection for neuronal signaling homeostasis drives the environmentally modulated fitness of natural *Ace* alleles: lower enzymatic activity in the cold requires more and highly active ACE, while at higher temperature lower quantities and less active ACE molecules are favored. Hence, neuronal signaling in natural populations can be modulated by Ace expression levels and the frequency of resistance alleles to accommodate for environment-specific signaling requirements. Using experimental evolution with tightly controlled environments, we demonstrate a previously unappreciated role of temperature dependent selection on neuronal signaling as an evolutionary force driving seasonal allele frequency changes of Ace in natural Drosophila populations.
