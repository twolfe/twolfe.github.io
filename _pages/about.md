Hello,  I am currently doing my PhD. in evolutionary biology under the supervision of Ovidiu Paun. Our group is, among other things, interested in the effect of polyploidisation on plant adaptability.

http://plantgenomics.univie.ac.at/research/

My present species of interest are part of the alpine Dactylorhiza genus, also known as marsh orchids. Using RNA-seq, I plan to find divergences in expression levels between polyploid and diploid species of these beautiful flowering plants. I also aim to integrate ecological and epigenetic data into my study to see how these contribute to the differentiation between these species.

The goal of this blog is to keep you updated on the progress of my work and findings. I hope you will enjoy, I surely will.
